Quite easy huh,

That's how we use the ICA to track records. It usually helps us.

But sometimes we got fake passports, they change names and photos. But remember, the ID will is always bind with their fingerprint.

So remember their IDs, it's going to help you in the future.

Good job, time to work on some real cases.
