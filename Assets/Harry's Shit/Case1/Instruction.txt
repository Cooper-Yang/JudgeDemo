You should be able to see the "Email" software we installed on your computer.

It's the first blue icon, you've probably tried it already.

Just in case you don't know how to use it:
1. In the console window, left click the area to the right of the colon.
2. Type "Help" or "help" to get all the commands. Upper case or lower case don't matter.

I don't expect you to master it soon, but the console isn't something hard, just keep playing around with it and you'll know how it works.
