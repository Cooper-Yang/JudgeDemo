#Intro to ICA#
#Comrade Yao Bang,
You might be confused by the ICA Database. It's used for getting passport records from the borders.

Try it yourself, our operative just went to Xing An this morning, request a record for the passports of people who passed Xing An, find the operative and print out his passport for submission.

Operative Name is: Song Xi Ye
Passport ID: IYR-4
