#Comrade Yao Bang,
We need you to use the ICA database on your computer to get passport records from the customs office.

Our operative just went to 'Xing An' this Morning. Launch the ICA database and Request a record for the passports that passed through Xing An. Find our operative and print out his passport for submission.

Operative Name is: Song Xi Ye
Passport ID: IYR-4
